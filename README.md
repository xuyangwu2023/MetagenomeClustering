Statement: I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to the individuals and organizations that have provided valuable resources and support for my code projects. I have also used relevant content from SpaRC (link: [https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/jgi-sparc/src/master/]) [1] and PSLDS (link: [https://github.com/hamid-roghani]) [2] during the development process.  

Although we named the PSLDS as the metagenomic data clustering method, this means that we use PSLDS [2] as core part for metagenomic data clustering.

I understand the importance of code referencing and knowledge sharing, and I hope that in the future, I will have the opportunity to give back my experience and results to the open source community and developers in general, so that we can jointly promote the progress and development of technology.
