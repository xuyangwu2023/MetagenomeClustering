Statement: I would like to express my sincerest gratitude to the individuals and organizations that have provided valuable resources and support for my code projects. 
I have also used relevant content from SpaRC (link: [[github link](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/jgi-sparc/src/master/)]) [1] and PSLDS (link: [github link]) [2] during the development process. 
I understand the importance of code referencing and knowledge sharing, and I hope that in the future, I will have the opportunity to give back my experience and results to the open source community and developers in general, so that we can jointly promote the progress and development of technology.
